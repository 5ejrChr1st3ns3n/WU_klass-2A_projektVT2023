            <h1 class="sub-title">Introduction</h1>
            <p>To get started with the mod you have to choose a controller type, which is just what controllers you use. In this case we’re using a quest 2 so we will pick “quest 2” in the drop down menu.<br>
            <br>
            The second thing you need to do is to pick a button, you’ll want to pick one that you won't be pressing while swinging, so for example if we swing like this then the X button is a good choice since it won't accidentally be pressed.<br>
            <br>
            Now if you already have some settings using either base game or some other settings mod you can actually import those into easy offset, just keep watching this video and i’ll explain how to do that. But if you’re making settings completely from scratch then you can skip the rest of this video and watch the next one.<br>
            <br>
            To import your settings you’ll want to exit to the main menu, go into the mod settings and find easy offset. Here you’ll see a “universal import” button, if it’s grayed out for you, simply turn off easy offset and click okay, once you come back you should be able to click the button.<br>
            <br>
            Now you want to turn on easy offset and make sure that if you have sabertailor, controllersettingshelper or any other settings mod downloaded that they are turned off.<br>
            <br>
            The settings should now be imported properly and you can go on to the next step.<br>

        <section class="guide_section">
            <h1 class="sub-title">Position Auto</h1>
            <p>To make your positions, you wanna open the adjustment mode menu and click position auto then activate “use free hand”. Now you want to hold down whichever button you chose in the first step and as you can see the saber on the other hand will start moving.<br>
            <br>
            you now need to do a twisting motion, to do this properly you want to keep your elbow in line with your side, and bend your arm 90 degrees. Then simply twist your forearm back and forth. You should now see the saber starting to move less which is exactly what we want, now, keeping the button pressed we need to do a waving motion.<br>
            <br>
            Simply move your hand as if you were greeting someone, but try to use as little arm as possible. You can now see how the dot at the base of the saber is staying very still which again, is the goal. Lastly, go back and do a twist motion again to make sure it’s correct and then you’re good to go for that hand and you can let go of the button. Now simply repeat that for the other hand and this step is done…<br>
            <br>

            <h1 class="sub-title">Rotation Auto</h1>
            <p>So before we start this step I have to warn you that you should only do this step if you are making settings from scratch since doing this will override all rotations you’re currently using.<br>
            <br>
            This step is very similar to the last one, hold down whichever button you chose in the first step and twist in the same way as you did for the positions. You should now see the saber rotating, then when you feel like it looks decent enough, let go of the button. Don’t worry if it doesn't look or feel quite right since the next two steps will improve them. Now do the same on the other hand and you can move on to the next step.<br>
            <br>

        <div id="jump_target_swingbench"></div>
        <section class="guide_section">
            <h1 class="sub-title">Swing Benchmark</h1>
            <p>To get some more accurate rotations you want to go into adjustment mode “swing benchmark” and then, just like in the last step, hold the button you’ve picked. You should see a disc appear, that's gonna show you what your swing looks like.<br>
            <br>
            Now keeping the button pressed just swing diagonally using as little arm as possible. This works even better if you close your eyes while doing it since you end up subconsciously compensating less. Now click apply rotation fix and do the same thing another one or two times on the same hand just to make sure what you got the first time wasn't a fluke.<br>
            <br>
            You’ll now want to press “set as reference”.  Now You’re done with that hand so you should do the exact same thing you just did but on the other hand, and again don't forget to click “set as reference”.<br>
            <br>
            Setting some settings as your reference is important since that will tell the mod all of your current setting values, which is necessary for fine adjustment in the next step which you can now go on to.<br>
            <br>
            </p>

        <section class="guide_section">
            <h1 class="sub-title">Manual Rotation Adjustment</h1>
            <p>This is the step where all the manual rotation adjustment will be done. You’ll see we have four sliders, two for each hand. The one labeled “balance” is going to rotate the saber up or down while the one labeled “curve” will rotate the saber left or right, in the beatsaber community we call this inward and outward, inward being left on right hand and right on left hand, just think of inward as being towards the middle and it should make a lot of sense.<br>
            <br>
            At this point the balance may be incorrect, and a good way to tell is to look under your headset and compare the saber rotation to the back of your hand. If the saber is pointing significantly further up or down than the back of your hand, adjust it to be as parallel as you can get it. I would not advise changing your curve here as the swing benchmark is usually quite accurate.<br>
            <br>
            You are now done and you want to save your settings. simply click save, and pick a name, here i will just name it tutorial, and you’re done. If you still don't feel like you understand what all of the different sliders do you can actually hold down the button in here as well, it will change the sliders in real time based on the movements you physically make which is a lot more intuitive for some people. But whether or not you choose to do that your config is finished and you can now go play some maps!<br>
